## Description

This is a memory game in which the player tries to find where eight pairs of cards are located among a shuffled set of 16 cards. The cards are laid out in a 4x4 grid. The player gets to open two cards at a time. If the cards match they stay open and the player is closer to winning the game. If the cards don't match they stay open for less than a second so that the player can try to remember them and then they close back up. The player wins the game when he/she has successfully matched all pairs of cards. The object of the game is to find all pairs in as little time and as few moves as possible.
